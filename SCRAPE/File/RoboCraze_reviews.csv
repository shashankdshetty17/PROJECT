10,"Guys beware, I know that all the Arduino boards out there on Amazon which are available for around 500₹ are clones of the original Arduino Uno board by arduino.ccBut this board is not even an exact clone, it doesn't even matched the original dimensions standards, this is a bit smaller than the normal boards (although it doesn't affects the functionality of the board) but still, for the money you're paying you should get at least an exact one, moreover the printing on the board is also a bit shabby, overall you can look at the board and say that the build quality doesn't matches the usual norms..!!",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 9 September 2020,"3.0 out of 5 stars
